## Welcome 
> The intellect,  character and skill possessed by any man are the product of certain original tendencies and the training which they have received. ---Edward L. Thorndike

Some of you may know, my personal blog using Wordpress Platform was forced to shut down because of virus attacking. 

After that I did heaps research and try to find a more user-friendly platform, easy maintenance, importantly stable and free, finally I choose Github Pages by using Jekyll as my solution. 

Jekyll is a free, simple, static site generator, without database for personal blog websites. Jekyll is written in Ruby, particularly it can be implemented on Github Pages. While there's a little bit complex is, the blog is written in Markdown, that is what I like, simple and easy insert coding scripts.

I will share my *TECH, LIFE, THINKING* and others I'm passionate about.

I'll introduce how to start a blog with **Jekyll & Github Pages** in the future.
